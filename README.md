# Agenda
---
Agenda is an android application for logging and completing daily tasks,
with the added feature of identifying when a certain task is being 'procrastinated' on.
---
The purpose of Agenda is for an individual to log tasks they need to do throughout the day.
If they complete them then the tasks are removed.If a day passes and a task is not completed
then these tasks 'overflow' (remain in the list), and a count for the amount of days since this 
task was set will increment.

The increment feature is to help a user notice what tasks they are procrastinating on,
and therefore reinforce the importance of completing them.

##Why?
I constantly found myself writing down the things to do each day on paper, and then
check of tasks when I completed them.However there were tasks I subconciously avoided.The
idea is that by having some sort of accountability/notification system then I can intelligently
adapt and combat certain unhelpful behaviours and remain productive.
